This project includes my C++ solutions to Cracking the Coding Interview (4th
edition), along with helper classes and some additional related problems.

Each solution includes the problem description from the book, as well as helpful
comments for tricky implementation details. Note that I also used these problems
as practice in implementing C++ functionality (such as templates, inheritance, 
operator overloading, etc.), so some solutions are more complicated than strictly 
necessary.

The code uses aspects of the C++11 standard, so it should be compiled with the
appropriate flag. For g++:
```
g++ -std=c++11 source_file.cpp
```
